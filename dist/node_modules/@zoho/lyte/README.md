Lyte is a Client Framework designed to help you build robust and reliable web applications in an efficient manner. Lyte framework helps you develop reusable custom UI components, enable navigation in your application, manage the application state, communicate with the back end, and more.

Lyte adheres to global web design standards and also implements incremental adaptation, thereby enabling scalability. Because of the framework's light-weighted nature, your application renders easily across all environments. You can access Lyte using an Integrated development toolkit, Lyte CLI, which would enable you to create and manage your applications from your local system.

How does Lyte work?
Lyte framework focuses on three layers, which work seamlessly and independently of each other. The decoupling of these layers allows them to work autonomously, where their functioning does not affect one another, and they are unware of each other's existence.

The three layers composing Lyte Framework are:

Router
The Router layer helps in browser navigation between the different views present. It defines the actions to be performed upon the navigation triggers in the application.

Components (View)
Lyte Components define the appearance and the behavior of the User View in your application. The components include several distinct technologies that are bundled together, and are also reusable in nature.

Data
The Data layer of Lyte acts as a client database. It holds the data that you want to process in the application, and provides the means of manipulating the data. It also connects the data to DOM, and the Client to the Server.
